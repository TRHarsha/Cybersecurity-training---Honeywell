## Introduction

When dealing with issues on a Windows system, several built-in commands can help diagnose and resolve problems related to network connectivity, system files, and overall system health. This README covers some of the most useful troubleshooting commands: `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, `sfc /scannow`, `chkdsk`, and `netstat`.

## Commands Overview

### 1. `ping`
The `ping` command tests the reachability of a host (like a website or another computer) on a network. It sends packets of data to the target and measures the time it takes for a response, helping identify network connectivity issues.

#### Usage:
```bash
ping [hostname or IP address]
```

#### Example:
```bash
ping google.com
```

### 2. `tracert`
The `tracert` (Trace Route) command traces the path packets take to reach a destination. It lists all intermediate routers (hops) between your computer and the target, helping to diagnose where network slowdowns or failures occur.

#### Usage:
```bash
tracert [hostname or IP address]
```

#### Example:
```bash
tracert google.com
```

### 3. `nslookup`
The `nslookup` (Name Server Lookup) command queries DNS servers to resolve domain names into IP addresses. It's useful for diagnosing DNS-related issues.

#### Usage:
```bash
nslookup [hostname]
```

#### Example:
```bash
nslookup google.com
```

### 4. `sfc /scannow`
The `sfc` (System File Checker) command checks the integrity of system files and repairs corrupted files. The `/scannow` option runs an immediate scan of all protected system files.

#### Usage:
```bash
sfc /scannow
```

### 5. `chkdsk`
The `chkdsk` (Check Disk) command checks the file system and disk for errors. It can scan for bad sectors, file system errors, and more, helping to maintain disk health.

#### Usage:
```bash
chkdsk [drive:] [/f] [/r]
```

- `/f` fixes errors on the disk.
- `/r` locates bad sectors and recovers readable information.

#### Example:
```bash
chkdsk C: /f /r
```

### 6. `netstat`
The `netstat` (Network Statistics) command displays active network connections, listening ports, and network statistics. Itâ€™s useful for monitoring network activity and identifying potential security issues.

#### Usage:
```bash
netstat [options]
```

- `-a` shows all connections and listening ports.
- `-b` shows the executable involved in creating each connection or listening port.

#### Example:
```bash
netstat -ab
```

## Practical Scenarios

6. **ipconfig:**

`ipconfig` is a command-line tool used in Windows operating systems to display and manage the network configuration of your computer. This tool provides a way to view the current IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other network-related information. It also includes commands to release and renew IP addresses, which can be useful for troubleshooting network issues.

## Commands Overview

### 1. `ipconfig`
The `ipconfig` command displays the current network configuration details of your computer. This includes:

- **IP Address:** The unique address assigned to your device on the network.
- **Subnet Mask:** Used to divide the IP address into network and host portions.
- **Default Gateway:** The device that routes traffic from your local network to other networks, like the internet.
- **DNS Servers:** Servers that translate domain names to IP addresses.

#### Usage:
```bash
ipconfig
```

### 2. `ipconfig /release`
The `ipconfig /release` command releases the current IP address assigned to your device by the DHCP server. This is useful when you want to disconnect from the network or refresh your IP address.

#### Usage:
```bash
ipconfig /release
```

### 3. `ipconfig /renew`
The `ipconfig /renew` command requests a new IP address from the DHCP server. This is typically used after releasing an IP address or when experiencing network connectivity issues.

#### Usage:
```bash
ipconfig /renew
```

## Practical Example

1. **View Current Network Configuration:**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   ipconfig /renew
   ```

These commands are often used in sequence to troubleshoot network issues, such as when a device is unable to connect to the internet or if there are IP conflicts on the network.


### **What is Network Architecture?**

Network Architecture refers to the design and structure of a computer network. It outlines the framework that defines how network devices and services are arranged, how data is transmitted across the network, and how resources are allocated. This includes the hardware components (like routers, switches, and servers), software protocols, the layout of the network (topology), and the modes of communication used (such as wired or wireless connections).

Network architecture is critical in ensuring that a network is efficient, secure, scalable, and meets the needs of the organization or users it serves.

#### **1. Fault Tolerance**

**Definition:**  
Fault tolerance is the ability of a network to continue operating correctly even when one or more of its components fail. This is achieved through redundancy, where critical components, such as routers, switches, and links, have backup systems that automatically take over in case of failure.

**Importance:**  
Fault tolerance ensures network reliability and availability, minimizing downtime and preventing data loss. This is crucial for mission-critical systems where continuous operation is necessary, such as in financial services, healthcare, and online services.

**Examples:**
- **Redundant Hardware:** Using multiple power supplies, network interfaces, and servers to ensure that if one fails, another can take over.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a point of failure.
- **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Using multiple hard drives to store data redundantly, so if one drive fails, data is not lost.

#### **2. Scalability**

**Definition:**  
Scalability refers to a network's ability to handle increased load or expand by adding more devices, users, or services without degrading performance or requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure.

**Importance:**  
A scalable network can grow to meet the demands of a growing business or organization. This makes it cost-effective and future-proof, as it can accommodate more users, applications, and services without needing a complete redesign.

**Examples:**
- **Modular Network Design:** Designing the network in a modular fashion allows for easy expansion by adding new modules or components as needed.
- **Cloud Computing:** Leveraging cloud services to scale resources like storage and processing power dynamically based on demand.
- **Hierarchical Network Model:** Implementing a three-layer (core, distribution, access) network model that allows for easy expansion at each layer.

#### **3. Quality of Service (QoS)**

**Definition:**  
Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the set of technologies and practices used to manage and prioritize network traffic to ensure the performance of critical applications, like video conferencing, VoIP, or online gaming.

**Importance:**  
QoS is vital for ensuring that important traffic gets the bandwidth and low latency it needs, while less critical traffic does not degrade the performance of key applications. This is particularly important in environments where different types of data have different requirements for speed and reliability.

**Examples:**
- **Traffic Prioritization:** Assigning higher priority to time-sensitive traffic (e.g., voice and video) over less critical traffic (e.g., file downloads).
- **Bandwidth Management:** Allocating bandwidth to ensure that high-priority applications have the resources they need to function correctly.
- **Latency Reduction:** Implementing techniques like traffic shaping and buffering to reduce delays in the network.

#### **4. Network Security**

**Definition:**  
Network security encompasses the strategies, technologies, and practices designed to protect a network and its data from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, destruction, or improper disclosure.

**Importance:**  
Network security is essential to safeguard sensitive data, maintain user privacy, and protect against cyber threats such as hacking, viruses, and ransomware. It ensures that only authorized users can access network resources and that data transmitted across the network is secure.

**Examples:**
- **Firewalls:** Hardware or software that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Encryption:** Scrambling data into an unreadable format to protect it during transmission and ensuring that only authorized parties can decode it.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and responding to potential threats in real-time.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** Creating secure, encrypted connections over a less secure network, like the internet, to protect data in transit.

### **Hierarchical Network Design**

Hierarchical Network Design is a structured approach to building networks that divides the network into distinct layers, each with specific roles and functions. This design methodology helps in managing and scaling networks efficiently. The most common hierarchical model consists of three layers: Access, Distribution, and Core.

---

#### **1. Physical and Logical Addresses**

- **Physical Address (MAC Address):**  
  - A Physical Address, or MAC (Media Access Control) address, is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer. It is used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure that data is sent to the correct physical device on a network segment.
  - **Example:** `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

- **Logical Address (IP Address):**  
  - A Logical Address, or IP address, is used to identify devices on a network and facilitate the routing of data across networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and is assigned by network administrators or automatically through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
  - **Example:** `192.168.1.10` (IPv4) or `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` (IPv6)

**Relevance in Hierarchical Networks:**  
- **Physical addresses** ensure local communication within a network segment (e.g., between devices connected to the same switch).
- **Logical addresses** enable communication across different network segments and the internet, allowing for efficient routing in a hierarchical design.

#### **5. Hierarchical Analogy**

- **Analogy:**  
  - Think of a hierarchical network like a corporate organizational chart. At the top (Core layer), you have the executives (high-speed backbone network), making broad, high-level decisions and connecting all parts of the organization. In the middle (Distribution layer), you have managers (routing between departments or VLANs), who implement the policies and decisions of the executives and ensure communication flows smoothly between departments. At the bottom (Access layer), you have the employees (end-user devices), who do the day-to-day work and connect to the resources they need.

**Purpose:**  
- This analogy helps to conceptualize how data and control flow through a hierarchical network, with each layer serving a distinct role, just as in a well-structured organization.

---

#### **6. Access, Distribution, and Core**

- **Access Layer:**  
  - The Access layer is where end-user devices (like computers, printers, and IoT devices) connect to the network. It provides network access, authentication, and basic security. Devices here typically connect to switches and wireless access points.

- **Distribution Layer:**  
  - The Distribution layer acts as an intermediary between the Access layer and the Core layer. It aggregates data from multiple Access layer switches and applies policies, such as routing between different subnets, VLANs, and enforcing security measures. It also manages traffic coming from or going to the Core layer.

- **Core Layer:**  
  - The Core layer is the backbone of the network. It is responsible for high-speed, reliable data transfer across the network. The Core layer connects the various Distribution layers and provides fault tolerance and redundancy. It typically involves powerful, high-capacity switches or routers.

**Purpose of Each Layer:**  
- **Access Layer:** Connects end devices to the network.
- **Distribution Layer:** Manages data flow between the Access layer and the Core layer, applying policies and routing.
- **Core Layer:** Provides fast and efficient backbone communication for the entire network, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
